# 💱 Flutter Multi-Currency Converter

## 📖 Project Description

This project is a professional multi-currency converter mobile application developed using Flutter and Dart. The application enables users to convert Pakistani Rupees (PKR) into more than 20 international currencies through a clean, modern, and user-friendly interface. It is built using Flutter’s Material Design system while maintaining consistent theme colors, proper spacing, and a responsive layout.

The main objective of this project is to demonstrate practical Flutter development skills including StatefulWidget usage, state management with setState(), TextEditingController handling, dropdown menu integration, and dynamic UI updates. The application uses structured data through Maps to manage currency rates, making it easy to modify, expand, and maintain.

Users can select currencies from a dropdown list that displays country flags, country names, and currency codes, providing a professional user experience similar to real-world financial applications. The project follows clean coding practices and scalable architecture, making it suitable for beginners learning Flutter as well as developers building portfolio projects.

This project highlights key mobile development concepts such as UI design, user input handling, responsive layout management, and modular code structure. It serves as a strong foundation for building advanced applications such as real-time currency converters, finance apps, or global tools.
